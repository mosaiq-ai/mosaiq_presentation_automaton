  - Implement:
    - [ ] Asynchronous generation with progress tracking
    - [ ] Context sharing between component agents
    - [ ] Caching integration
    - [ ] Progress callback support

### API Endpoints for Asynchronous Generation
- [ ] Create API endpoints for async generation
  - File: `/backend/src/api/async_router.py`
  - Implement:
    - [ ] Endpoint for starting async generation
    - [ ] Endpoint for starting async generation from file
    - [ ] Endpoint for checking generation status
    - [ ] Endpoint for retrieving generation results
    - [ ] Server-sent events for progress tracking

### Update Main API Module
- [ ] Update main API app with task manager lifecycle
  - File: `/backend/src/api/app.py` (update)
  - Implement:
    - [ ] Include async router
    - [ ] Update startup event to initialize task manager
    - [ ] Update shutdown event to stop task manager

### Create Cache Directory
- [ ] Create cache directory for persistent caching
  - Directory: `/backend/cache/`

## Verification Steps
- [ ] Test document processing with different formats
  ```bash
  # Create a test script to verify document processing
  python -c "import asyncio; from src.services.document_processor import process_document; asyncio.run(process_document(...))"
  ```
- [ ] Test asynchronous task system
  ```bash
  # Create a test script to verify task manager
  python -c "import asyncio; from src.services.task_manager import task_manager; asyncio.run(task_manager.start()); ..."
  ```
- [ ] Test caching service
  ```bash
  # Create a test script to verify caching
  python -c "import asyncio; from src.services.cache_service import cache_service; asyncio.run(cache_service.set('test', 'value')); ..."
  ```
- [ ] Test async API endpoints
  ```bash
  # Start the server
  ./run.sh
  
  # Test async generation
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-async \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"document_text": "# Sample Document\n\nThis is a test document."}'
  
  # Test status endpoint with the returned task_id
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/generation/{task_id}/status
  ```

## Dependencies
- Python-docx for DOCX processing
- PyPDF2 for PDF processing
- AsyncIO for asynchronous operations
- SSE-Starlette for server-sent events

## Estimated Completion Time
Approximately 1-2 weeks for a junior engineer.
