## Verification Steps
- [ ] Test presentation CRUD operations
  ```bash
  # Create a presentation
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/presentations \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"title": "Test Presentation", "slides": [...]}'
    
  # Get a presentation
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/presentations/{id} \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  ```
- [ ] Test user authentication
  ```bash
  # Register a user
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "securepassword", "name": "Test User"}'
    
  # Login
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}'
  ```
